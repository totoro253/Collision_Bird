# Nocturnal flight-calling behaviour predicts vulnerability to artificial light in migratory birds

"Understanding interactions between biota and the built environment is increasingly important as human modification of the landscape expands in extent and intensity. For migratory birds, collisions with lighted structures are a major cause of mortality, but the mechanisms behind these collisions are poorly understood. Using 40 years of collision records of passerine birds, we investigated the importance of speciesâ€™ behavioral ecologies in predicting rates of building collisions during nocturnal migration through Chicago, IL and Cleveland, OH, USA. We found that use of nocturnal flight calls is an important predictor of collision risk in nocturnally migrating passerine birds. Species that produce flight calls during nocturnal migration collided with buildings more than expected given their local abundance, whereas those that do not use such communication collided much less frequently. Our results suggest that a stronger attraction response to artificial light at night in species that produce flight calls may mediate these differences in collision rates. Nocturnal flight calls likely evolved to facilitate collective decision-making during navigation, but this same social behavior may now exacerbate vulnerability to a widespread anthropogenic disturbance."

# R-Ladies project 
Begin january 2021 I started to attend the project R-Ladies. Due the first meeting my group decided to pick datasets from TidyTuesday.
The reason I chose this dataset is because I am interested in the interaction between biota and the environment. During the process our group decided to follow 2 books :

My main focus was learning to explore/wrangle and visualize the data in a efficient way.
